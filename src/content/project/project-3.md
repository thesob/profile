# Blog list app
This is a fullstack app developed in React, node.js, and mongodb to keep hold and maintain a list of favorite blogs. Anyone can vote on a blog, to let it show upper on the list, but only created users can add blogs. For now, no users can be added in the UX

# Why
As part of the fullstack javascript course (MOOC)  held by Helsinky University, which is highly recommeded by the way, one of the projects to complete was creating a blog site. I spent lot of time using the components of MaterialUI from Google, so I figured out, the project should be of interest to anyone interested in that.

# How it was built
Built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB, thus a fullstack project.
