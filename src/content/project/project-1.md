# Timer
Simple half stack React tool to measure elapsed time on a project. It stores the elapased time in localPageStorage, thus any refresh or browser restart will maintain elapsed time. You can change the project name of the project, and open a separate tab for each task you want to track. You can start the time at any timestamp. Supports nearly any limitation on elapsed time, counter is second based.
