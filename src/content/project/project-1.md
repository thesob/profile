# Timer
Simple tool to measure elapsed time on a project or task. It stores the elapased time in local sessionStorage, thus any refresh or browser restart will maintain elapsed time. You can change the project name of the project, and open a separate tab for each project you want to track. You can set the start time too, and  nearly no limitation on elapsed time. The counter is second based.

# Why
When working through the MOOC course at Helsinki University for Fullstack JS, upon submitting the exercises, I had to mention the time spent on the course and programming for each part. I soon realized it would be hard for me to keep track manually, so I felt an app to keep track of elapsed time would be beneficial. There are plenty of solutions out there but most of them have a lot of ads and cookeies that I wished not to have. 

# How it was built
Built with React, only frontend. Wanted to keep it simple, thus the UI is simple. To simplify the design I used the mantine components, fast start.
