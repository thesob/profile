# Society of Mind by Marvin Minsky
Came recently across the book "The Society of Mind" by Marvin Minsky from 1986, and it compels my curiosity to creating intelligent assistants, fit for companionship purposes. The thoughts presented, summarized below, makes me recall psychodynamic psychology as understood by Freud.
According to ChatGPT, the book is a groundbreaking book in the field of artificial intelligence. In it, Minsky proposes a new theory of the mind that views it as a collection of small, interconnected agents, or "sub-minds," that work together to create intelligent behavior.
According to Minsky, these sub-minds are responsible for performing specific tasks such as perception, memory, reasoning, and decision making. They are organized in a hierarchical manner, with lower-level agents performing more basic functions and higher-level agents coordinating the behavior of lower-level agents.

Minsky argues that the human mind is not a single entity but rather a complex system made up of these sub-minds, and that by understanding how these sub-minds work together, we can create machines that can perform intelligent tasks.

The book covers a wide range of topics, including the nature of consciousness, the role of emotions in cognition, and the relationship between language and thought. Minsky also explores the implications of his theory for fields such as psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience.
Overall, "The Society of Mind" is a thought-provoking and influential book that offers a new way of thinking about the nature of intelligence and the mind. [Wikipedia - a Society of Mind](https://lnkd.in/dWAFZrft)
