In my journey of entering the realm of AI, ML (Machine Learning) and DL (Deep Learning) I've come across several useful resources that have boosted my learning on the subject.
Below you'll find a list of carefully selected sources that I myself have used to gain more knowledge about a particular domain related to AI.
