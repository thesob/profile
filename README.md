# Personal Porfolio Website

Created this site starting with the [Astrofy](https://astrofy-template.netlify.app/) template. Astrofy is a free and open-source template for creating Personal Portfolio Website built with Astro and TailwindCSS. The great benefit of Astro is that it's fast, it contains very little javascript pushed to the browser, it's usage reminds very much of other frameworks such as React, Vue, and it can be easily integrated with components from these and other javascript frameworks.

### Components usage

#### Interactive Components

The home page shows on the top a button that changes hello word randomly on each click. It scrambles among 5 lanaguages, English, Spanish, Rumanian, Italian and Swedish, which happen to be the languages I speak. The component was made with Preact.

#### Layout Components

The `BaseHead`, `Footer`, `Header` and `SideBar` components are already included in the layout system. To change the website content you can edit the content of this components.

##### SideBar

In the Sidebar you can change your profilePicture, links to all your website pages and your social icons.

You can change your avatar shape using [mask classes](https://daisyui.com/components/mask/).

The used social-icons are SVG form [BoxIcons](https://boxicons.com/) pack. You can replace the icons in the `SideBarFooter` component

To add a new page in the sidebar go to `SideBarMenu` component.

```
<li><a class="py-3 text-base" id="home" href="/">Home</a></li>

```

**Note**: In order to change the sidebar menu's active item, you need to setup the prop `sideBarActiveItemID` in the `BaseLayout` component of your new page and add that id to the link in the `SideBarMenu`

#### TimeLine

The timeline components are used to conform the CV.

```html
<div class="time-line-container">
  <TimeLineElement title="Element Title" subtitle="Subtitle">
    Content that can contain
    <div>divs</div>
    and <span>anything else you want</span>.
  </TimeLineElement>
  ...
</div>
```

#### Card & HorizontalCard

```html
<HorizontalCard title="Card Title" img="imge_url" desc="Description" url="Link
URL" target="Optional link target (_blank default)" badge="Optional badge"
tags={['Array','of','tags']} />
```


### Layouts

Include `BaseLayout` in each page you add and `PostLayout` to your post pages.

### Content

You can add a [content collection](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) in `/content/' folder, you will need add it at config.ts.

#### config.ts

Where you need to define your content collections, we define our content schemas too.

#### Blog

Add your `md` blog post in the `/content/blog/` folder.

##### Post format

Add code with this format in the top of each post file.

```
---
title: "Post Title"
description: "Description"
pubDate: "Post date format(Sep 10 2022)"
heroImage: "Post Hero Image URL"
---
```

### Pages

#### Blog

Blog uses Astro's content collection to query post's `md`.

##### [page].astro

The `[page].astro` is the route to work with the paginated post list. You can change there the number of items listed for each page and the pagination button labels.

##### [slug].astro

The `[slug].astro` is the base route for every blog post, you can customize the page layout or behaviour, by default uses `content/blog` for content collection and `PostLayout` as layout.

#### Project

Add your `md` item in the `/pages/project/` folder.

##### [page].astro

The `[page].astro` is the route to work with the paginated item list. You can change there the number of items listed for each page and the pagination button labels. The project page will render all `.md` files you include inside this folder.

##### Item format

Add code with this format in the top of each item file.

```js
---
title: "Demo Item 1"
description: "Item description"
heroImage: "Item img url"
visit_link_label: "Visit btn link label"
visit_link: "Visit btn link"
pubDate: "Sep 15 2022"
badge: "Featured"
---
```

#### Static pages

The other pages inlcuded in the template are static pages. The `index` page belong to the root page. You can add your pages directly in the `/pages` folder and then add a link to that pages in the `sidebar` component.

Feel free to modify the content included in the pages that the template contains or add the ones you need.

### Theming

To change the template theme, change the `data-theme` atribute of the `<html>` tag in `BaseLayout.astro` file.

You can chose among 30 themes available or create your custom theme. See themes available [here](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/).

## Sitemap

The Sitemap is generated automatically when you build your website in the root of the domain. Please update the `robots.txt` file in the public folder with your site name URL for the Sitemap.

## Deploy

You can deploy your site on your favorite static hosting service such as Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.

The configuration for the deployment varies depending on the platform where you are going to do it. See the [official Astro information](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) to deploy your website.

> **⚠️ CAUTION** </br>
> The Blog pagination of this template is implemented using dynamic route parameters in its filename and for now this format is incompatible with SSR deploy configs, so please use the default static deploy options for your deployments.
