# Personal Porfolio Website

Created this site starting with the [Astrofy](https://astrofy-template.netlify.app/) template, that I tailored to my needs, using Astro and TailwindCSS. The great benefit of Astro is that it's fast, it contains very little javascript pushed to the browser, it's usage reminds very much of other frameworks such as React, and it can be easily integrated with components from these and other javascript frameworks.

### Components usage

#### Interactive Components

The home page shows on the top a button that changes hello word randomly on each click. It scrambles among 5 lanaguages, English, Spanish, Rumanian, Italian and Swedish, which happen to be the languages I speak. The component was made with Preact.
